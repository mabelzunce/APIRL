\section intro Introduction
The current APIRL code is a siimplified version of the APIRL library that can be found in , which was originally developed to be used in the AR-PET scanner
and in a Tomographic Gamma Scanner (TGS), a SPECT system to perform non-destructive assays of nuclear waste drums. Later on was modified to include projectors
and other tools necesary to reconstruct images from Siemens mMR scanners, with a MATLAB interface to make it friendly for research purposes. MAP and MAP MR-guided functions 
were also included.

In this spin-off of that library, the code was simplified to include projectors and tools to perform reconstruction for the mMR scanner or any generic cylidindrical scanner.
It also includes the codes to perform MAP MR-guided reconstructions.


In order to contribute to this library, please follow the naming convention found in: \ref naming .

\section naming Naming convention
The naming convention for coding is based on the folowwing guide:
Basically, the following rules should be followed:
